# Manage a remote team

Whether you work in an office or from Starbucks, being a manager is a hard job. You have to be the listener, planner, educator, and cheerleader for a group of people working towards a larger vision.

## Good remote leadership

Especially when it comes to managing a remote team, your organization and communication skills need to be on-point. Some basic tenants of great remote leadership:

- **Be organized.** Great leaders are organized, plan ahead, and over-communicate their ideas. They take the time to set goals for themselves and the people around them, and are clear in their vision of the future.

- **Continuously connect.** You are managing a team of people, each with their own career aspirations and life goals. A remote team is only as good as the structure around it. Your job as a leader is to set the vision, provide guide rails, and make sure everyone is productive and feeling positive.

- **Believe in the people you hire:** Trust is the foundation to any team, but for a remote team, it’s dire. If you are not sure what your employees are doing, you need to make a change to the way communication is done. Hire smart people to implement the plan. Create transparent and detailed task boards, schedule weekly 1:1s, and daily standup. By doing so, you and your team will be more productive.

- **You’re a boss so you need a schedule\*\***: \*\*Set a stable daily routine to create the structure of an office without the brick and mortar. Encourage your team to set their own schedule at generally the same time each day. As a leader, you can set up a weekly cadence with the events you put on the calendar.

## Communication toolkit

Defining expectations and providing a transparent roadmap are qualities of good leadership - whether sitting next to someone physically or 3,000 miles away.

For a fully remote team, asynchronous communication is key. Each team member needs to understand the tools being used to communicate, the defined processes in place, and what they should be focusing on each day.

Mix-and-match, and make it a routine:

- **Written documentation**: You can’t (and shouldn’t) just tap people on the shoulder each time you need help. Give all team members the resources they need to succeed by writing down common practices. Day-to-day functions of the company should be written up in an easy-to-read format, and organized in the right place for people to access. Use something like Google Drive, Notion, or Evernote for wiki software. The [Gitlab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) is openly available and an amazing resource, and other companies are opening their company handbooks - such as the [Sourcegraph Handbook](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook).

- **Synchronous conversations**: Tools like Slack imitate live conversations where people are in the same room. Use synchronous chat this when you need a quick answer or a fast back-and-forth. Just remember that your ideas may get lost in the hustle - these tools enable short-term collaboration, not long-term storage.

- **Asynchronous conversations**: If you have team members in multiple locations, you will want to lean heavily on more static forms of communication. Email, document commenting, and wiki software are all good ways to capture thinking and allow each team member to add thoughtful perspectives. These kinds of tools can help you document ideas and search for answers in a more structured format.

- **Video calls and recordings**: Context can be lost when you don’t have face-to-face time. Videos are an important medium to bring into the mix to build empathy, tell stories, and feel a more personal connection. Use Zoom for live meetings, and Loom for screen recording with voice-over.

- **Live group meetings**: Make sure you have time during the week for the whole team or company to get together. You may be all over the globe, but it’s just as important to have all-hands or team meetings once a week.

- **Remote social time**: In a traditional office setting, you have casual conversations in the hallways or during lunch. When everyone is remote, it’s important to find ways to build in unfocused social time. These can come in the form of 1:1 meetings, virtual tea time, or extra time at the end of collaboration meetings.

- **In-person**: Yes, sometimes you still need to be in the same room! Bring the team together for quarterly work-aways or offsites - which should be a mix of work and play. And make sure that people know each other on a personal level, so that you are building camaraderie and trust while working together!

## Planning toolkit

To keep a group of people moving towards a common end goal, there needs to be a clear and transparent plan in place. There should be a single source of truth where all team members can understand the tasks for today, and the long-term vision for the future.

- **Long-form weekly updates**: Create a mailing list with focused groups of people, and send structured updates on a schedule. For example, send an email each Monday to the internal product team with stats, progress, goals, and updates for the week. At minimum, you should do this for your internal team weekly, and your investors monthly. No one can read your mind, so it makes sure you are keeping everyone engaged and on the same page.

- **Task board and weekly sprints**: Use a tool like JIRA, Notion, or Trello to track each person’s progress. Create a Kanban board with backlog, queue, in-progress, and done columns. Managers and the leadership team should review the board each Monday to organize, prioritize, and assign tasks for the week. Planning meetings should refer back to the task board for insight on time management and progress.

- **Critiques and feedback**: Throughout the lifecycle of each project, the relevant stakeholders should come together to review progress and provide constructive criticism. The idea of "critique" is a common design process that can be used to collect ideas from the whole team to make better decisions in a more iterative fashion. Use a Zoom meeting to get everyone in the same place at the same time for this live conversation.

- **1:1s:** Each member of the team should have a weekly video meeting with someone on the leadership team (ideally their manager). This meeting should be used to talk about active projects and long-term career goals. It’s also a great way to feel more connected and get some added social time. Try not to skip this meeting, even if you don’t have any hot topics to discuss!

## Set a remote culture

Working remotely allows for flexibility and ownership for both companies and workers. But it also can lead to isolation and loneliness. The traditional physical office gets people to set a routine each day, form relationships with their co-workers, and connect in-person (in real life!).

When you don’t have that shared physical space of an office, it’s important to proactively build in social time around the work week, and to feel grounded in a routine.

**Casual social time**: Set aside devoted time for casual social interaction. Put time on the calendar each week for team members to talk about work, home, dogs, kids, whatever. Chat 1:1, or add something like a "virtual tea time" where anyone who is available can join.

**Social work spaces**: Instead of going to an office each day, people are going to work from wherever their computer is. Make sure that people feel comfortable working from co-working or public spaces if they want. While they may not see co-workers, they will be connected to their own professional community.

**Community**: Find ways to encourage after-work activities like meetups, conferences, events, or clubs. This social time is crucial to avoiding feelings of isolation, frustration, and loneliness.

**Remote office perks**: Provide perks and gifts that build group camradere. Define the standard remote desk setup (computer, external monitor, etc.), and purchase those items for their start date - just like you would do if they were in your office. Send a "remote work office gift" every 4-8 weeks to keep morale high and create a feeling of support.

**Team offsites**: There are still times when it makes sense to meetup in-person. Bring teams together for a new employee’s first week. And try to bring the entire team together for offsites or work-aways 3-4 times per year. The goal for in-person events should be to socialize and connect, not for hack-a-thons or focused work.
