# Introduction

We are living in a new kind of global economy. People who might never meet face-to-face are working together daily. Knowledge work is becoming more accessible for people everywhere in the world, and technology talent is no longer exclusive to Silicon Valley.

We created this guide to help more people go remote, and take ownership over their work life. This guide is based off of our experience originally as remote workers ourselves, and now as a 100% remote team. This encyclopedia is open source, and we hope that the whole remote community will contribute to make it better over time.

Whether youâ€™re looking for a more flexible way to work as a maker, or to build an amazing remote team - this guide will help you get started, stay productive, and build a better future of work.
