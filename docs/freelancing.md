# Become a remote contractor

Building your own consulting business means you get to be your own boss, set your hours, and work from wherever. It also means you are running an entire business. You need to figure out the logistics of sales, getting paid, taxes, insurance, account management, and buying your own office setup.

While you have control over your income based on project proposals and hours worked, you also can go spans of time without working. With great freedom comes great responsibility!

## Getting your business running

### Incorporation

Itâ€™s a smart idea to start an LLC to do your freelancing work. Running your work as an LLC protects you legally in many ways as an individual, and ensures you have an entity for taxes and accounting. Read more about the legal and accounting benefits of [setting up an LLC](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/freelancer/llc-for-freelancer/) for your freelancing business.

### Contracts

Getting and signing legal contracts with your clients will create peace-of-mind and clarity for both sides. You want to make sure the work expectations, payment, and timeline are agreed upon _before_ you start working. Draft up a work agreement using something like [Rocket Lawyer](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/sem/work-for-hire-agreement.rl?id=97&partnerid=103&cid=1876582495&adgid=77474804131&loc_int=&loc_phys=9073497&mt=b&ntwk=g&dv=c&adid=347622084638&kw=%2Bwork%20%2Bagreement&adpos=1t1&plc=&trgt=&trgtid=kwd-30539645204&gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRW-UpIFFvqfNuBSYpaa7V_pZq4gs4J6fIYnBFLeNqPXvThqP44oRnEhoC3PAQAvD_BwE#/) or [Hello Bonsai](https://www.hellobonsai.com/freelance-contracts?). Send it to clients using [HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com/) or [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/). Companies will often have their own paperwork as well.

### Taxes

Unless youâ€™re very comfortable with your accounting and finance skills, hire a professional. They will help you understand state and federal laws where you pay taxes, and make sure you save enough throughout the year to prepare. They can also advise you on tax write offs, business expenses, and small business perks (_hint_: your whole life is not a write off).

### Sales prospects

Set up a contact management system (you are your own sales team!). Youâ€™ll need to keep track of all the people you are meeting and working for. When youâ€™re ready for a new project, pull out your "rolodex" of contacts and start going down the list to find your next opportunity. This can be as basic as a written list, or as complex as an airtable hooked into your email marketing tools.

### Managing Your Payouts

Now that you now have the logistics in order, itâ€™s time to get paid. You can negotiate with each client on how they want to set up the payment structure.

Choose whether you want to be paid hourly, daily or weekly, or based on milestone completion. Think about how big the company is, how large the project is, and how you do the best work. Make sure to record the hours you work, along with notes on what you worked on during that time.

Getting paid on time can be one of the hardest things about running your own freelancing business. Many companies have long procurement processes (often up to 90 days) with tools like Bill.com, which processes payments with physical checks. Make sure you know how the company plans to pay you from the beginning.

### Health Insurance

Since you likely wonâ€™t have company benefits to lean on, you have to figure it all out on your own. Get yourself secured with both health and work insurance. Even if you are healthy and confident in your working ability, the safety net is worth it!

- [Oscar](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/9-health-insurance-hacks-for-freelancers)

### Work insurance

Errors and omissions insurance, and general liability insurance are two extra insurance plans you should consider. These will protect you if someone tries to sue you for the work you perform. Most large companies would already have you covered under their plan, but as a one-person or small team, itâ€™s worth the added level of protection.
