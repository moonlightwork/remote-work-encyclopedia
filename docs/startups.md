To succeed as a startup (whether co-located or remote!), you need to build something people want and prove that you have some kind of traction. It really doesn't matter where your employees are located until you have the basics of an interesting and profitable business.

### Meet people and talk to your users

It’s hard and slow to launch a startup. No matter where you are located, you will need a support network of founders, investors, and talent. Join a co-working space, partake in online forums, and go to in-person events to get connected.

As with any business, the first step to gaining traction is talking with your users. It’s the fastest way to succeed with an early product or service and the best way to ensure an amazing experience. Make sure you are talking to your users daily!

_**Tip**: Embed a Calendly page as one of your onboarding steps and offer some kind of free service over a video call. It’s an easy way to talk with more people, learn from them, and gain trust from the users._

### Prove your idea

The MVP of your product does not need to be backed by any kind of crazy technology. It’s just the simplest thing you can get out there to prove the idea and get people to pay you.

The first version could just be a landing page where a human is manually performing a service. If it’s a batch photo editing app - do it by hand! If it’s an insurance matchmaker - send them a PDF you researched personally!

Getting real users to pay you to use a product or service is the only way to prove the business model. Until you get to that point, you’re just playing around on the internet.

### Raise Venture Funding

Recent market changes have made it safe for your startup to embrace being remote, and to sell it to investors as an advantage. You don’t have to live in Palo Alto, and you don’t need to raise money to build out an overpriced office. 

So if investors ask you "why remote?" here are some recommended talking points:

- **Pipeline of talent:** Without the geographic restriction of a shared office, you get far better access to talent. This will lead to quicker hires and more specialized candidates.

- **Lower average costs:** If employees live somewhere cheaper than SF (which is almost anywhere else), they get a higher standard of living while the company saves money.

- **More diverse candidates**: Hiring in more places gives you access to people with different beliefs, perspectives, backgrounds, ages, lifestyles, nationalities, ethnicities, education, and more.

- **Retention**: Keeping employees retained is much easier when they have the flexibility to work where and when they want. Time and lifestyle are often more valuable to remote workers than inflated tech salaries.

- **Maturity**: Going remote means that communication, processes, and leadership need to be a priority from day one. Once your team is ready to scale, there will be less friction.

## Ditch the open office

If you search the internet for "best startup offices", you’ll see photos of open office plans, ping pong tables, and in-office cafeterias. All things that have nothing to do with getting the work done. Workers get packed into farms of desks that look like factories. Tiny conference rooms and call booths can [result in carbon monoxide poisoning](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/health/conference-room-air.html) or [formaldehyde poisoning](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/14/wework-pulls-thousands-of-phone-booths-out-of-service-over-formaldehyde-scare/). Not cool!

Today’s tech offices are designed for socializing, not productivity. Interruptions, meetings, and annoying shoulder taps segment the day into unproductive chunks of time. Knowledge workers need long periods of uninterrupted time to enter a flow state.

In the modern work environment, you do not need the whole team in the same room. Each person will have their own ideal path to productivity and focus. All you need is an organized plan, a defined process, and clear communication.
