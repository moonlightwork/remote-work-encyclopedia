# Hire a great team

Hiring remotely requires a new way of thinking in many ways, including your interview process. It de-risks your hiring decisions and helps you identify the best people on the market (or even off the market!)

## The remote interview process

The biggest change is that you’re not interviewing to meet someone you can sit next to in an office for hours on end. You are vetting someone to make sure they have the expertise you need, a vision of the future that maps to the role you are hiring for, and that they are a good communicator.

### Job post

When you write the job post, be transparent and inclusive. Remember that you are talking to a wide audience, not just candidates who have worked in Silicon Valley tech before. Get people excited about your mission, vision, team, and what exactly they will be working on.

### Written screen

In each place that you post the job, include a set of written questions. This will quickly weed out candidates who are not a good fit because of skill set, communication style, and motivation. You’ll learn insights of people you could not have learned through a phone call (people share a lot when they have time to think!) You can see an example here.

### Intro video call

Set up a time to talk in real time to learn more about the person, how they communicate, get details on their past experience, and decide if they should move on in the process.

### Specialized video interview

This live interview should be with someone who would be on their team - like an engineering manager who can vet their technical ability. Ask them to talk you through a past technical problem they have solved, or show them a current problem and ask if they can walk you through their thinking process. Make sure the interviewer knows what qualities they are looking for before the interview begins.

### Paid project

The best way to de-risk a hire is to actually work together on a real project. Define a real project, pay them hourly for their time, and work on something together. The end result should be a pull request (or something similar) so that you can see their communication style, level of polish, and problem solving ability. You can continue this contract project until you have made a clear yes or no decision. Hold weekly meetings with the candidate for as long as you are working together. (See The paid project section for more detail).

### The offer!

Once you feel confident that you have found the right person for your team, set up a call. Give them the offer verbally, share how excited you are to have them join the team, and ask them if they have any concerns. Send over the offer paperwork via HelloSign or DocuSign, for your future employee to sign!

## The paid project

Companies like Google have a well-known, long, and rigorous interview process around whiteboarding conceptual problems in a conference room together. While this is one proven way to vet technical candidates, it takes a lot of time and is largely theoretical. It was also defined for a time when people would be sitting together all in one office.

As a remote team - you need to be testing for independence, technical ability, and communication style. Using a contract-to-hire process de-risks hiring and makes yes or no decisions really clear.

Here’s how to set up your paid projects:

1. **Define contained tasks:** Write up defined "contractor-ready" tasks. These tasks should be real problems you want to solve in your code base, that don’t require a complex understanding of the entire system. Examples would be making changes to permissions, changing the timing for system onboarding emails, or making updates to the input field error interface.

2. **Assign a task**: After signing a contract with the developer, assign them to a task (this could be with limited permissions on an actual task board, or via email/slack). Make sure they have access to any tools, code, or resources they need to get started.

3. **Work and collaborate:** This is a test of communication and working style, just as much as it’s a test of technical ability. Work together throughout the week and try to integrate them onto the team with daily practices like check-ins, team Slack, and weekly 1:1s. This contract-to-hire process can last as long as you need to get to a "yes" or “no.”

4. **Pay candidates for their time**: Pay the developer for hours worked, whether you end up hiring them or not. Paid work will give you a more realistic and transparent view into what kind of work they do. It’s also a great way to attract talented people!

5. **Task completion**: Have the contractor pass off code or designs once the task is complete. This should come in the form of a pull request or something similar so that you can also see how they collaborate and write documentation.

## Diversity and Inclusion

You are looking to hire the best people out there, and you need to create a healthy business together. One of the most proven ways to succeed as a business is to bring in diverse perspectives and work on problems together.

Hiring remote employees is the easiest way to get outside your personal network and bring in the best people for the job (hint: they don’t all look and think like you, and don’t all live in your city!)

### Write an inclusive job post

You want to attract hard workers, so it’s tempting to use words that you might use polarizing words, like "ambitious," “expert,” or “superstar.” But, these words are proven to attract a non-diverse audience, often leading women and other minorities to self-select out of your hiring process altogether. Be sure to tell people about company values, mission, and what they will be working on. They are vetting you for culture, just as much as you are vetting them for talent.

### Meet people outside your personal network

People are naturally attracted to those who are similar to them. You need to get outside your bubble of influence if you want to find a diverse team. Being a remote company makes this easier, but you still need to go out of your way to increase awareness to a broader group of potential applicants.

Communities to share your job post:

- Elpha

- Ladies Get Paid

- Tech Ladies

- Remote Woman

- Slack communities with a proper code of conduct

### Use a structured interview process:

One of the proven ways to run a less biased interview process is to define what you’re looking for from the beginning, and make the whole team aware. The same written evaluation criteria should be completed after every interview. Running a structured interview narrows the focus to be about ability and potential, not on likeability or personal similarities.
