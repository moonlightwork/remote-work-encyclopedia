# Land a remote job

Job searching will always be hard. Whether you want a 9-5 in an office or a remote job with flexibility, you are still making a relatively long-term decision about your daily existence (⅓ of your life is spent working!) With the shift towards location-independent careers, there are tons of new possibilities that allow you to build a successful career on your terms.

While you may be working from _anywhere_, your needs as an employee are generally the same as in an office job. You need to work on something interesting, you need to get paid enough to reach your life goals, and you need to feel like your career growth will be supported.

## The new resume is your online identity

Every public profile you have online will likely be reviewed by the people you are interviewing with. Your personal website, LinkedIn, Github, Medium, Twitter - these will all be used as part of the decision on whether to hire you as a remote employee.

You need to come across as a clear communicator, trustworthy as a person, and competent in the skills they are hiring you for. Yes, it’s annoying to fill out a bunch of past experience sections and manage each bio, but your attention to detail will make all the difference in standing out from a sea of similar candidates.

What you need to prove with your online identity:

- **You have great communication skills**: This is extra important for remote teams. You need to be able to convey ideas to your teammates both live and in written form. Make sure your professional profiles show this with good grammar and clear, concise communication.

- **You are experienced**: For remote companies, it’s likely that you have no personal connections inside the company. Your online presence needs to prove that you have done this kind of work in the past. List your past companies, show actual work completed, and explain what you personally did to create value.

- **You have skills**: Your hard skills are the baseline for why someone is interested in hiring you. Make sure you are telling them the tech stack you are an expert in, and back it up with any past projects using those skills.

- **You are trustworthy**: Without an initial in-person meeting, it’s harder to make a personal connection. You need to come across as a trustworthy human on the other end. Use a real photo of yourself, write with a friendly and concise tone, and share a complete story about your personal and professional history.

## Where to find remote jobs

Just like a normal job search, you will likely need to apply to lots of jobs to find the right fit. Your personal network will come in handy, but you can use online networks to expand your reach globally.

Start building up your online network _before_ your ready for a new job. Sign up for as many tech communities and industry-specific forums as you can, and start engaging.

## Nailing the remote interview

The interview process will be different for a fully remote team than for a co-located company. You may never meet someone in person before being given an offer. This means that your skills, interests, communication style, and personality need to come through other means.

Tenants of the remote interview:

- **Written interview questions**: The first step in the interview process will likely be some kind of written screen. It’s easy to breeze through this step since it feels like a formality, but this is really where you should be spending the most time. It’s the first opportunity for you to stand out from other candidates, and it’s extremely important to prove that you are a great asynchronous communicator that can work remotely.

- **Video interviews**: Try to get on a video call rather than a phone call for the first meeting. This gives you far more ways to connect with the interviewer. You can communicate with body language, express emotions through facial features, share your screen, and get a better feel for what the human on the other end is like.

- **Emails**: Talking with the team via email (or any other kind of remote messaging tool) is a test in itself. As a remote worker (no matter your job title), written communication will be your primary collaboration interface. You should be proving your skills already by following up after calls, communicating clearly, and responding in a timely manner.

- **Technical project**: Once you make it through the initial few screening conversations, you will likely be given a contract trial period or technical take-home project. This is your chance to prove your technical ability, daily communication style, and process. Even if they just ask you to complete a task, remember that it’s about the whole package - not just the end result. Even if it’s not requested, but sure to end the project with a presentation or video walk-through explaining your strategy and decisions.
