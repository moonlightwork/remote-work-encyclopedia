# Career growth

In the old world of work, you had to choose between flexibility and success. It was rare to find a position where you could work outside the headquarters, set your own hours, _and_ maintain career growth.

The normalization of remote work has completely changed this. Modern tools enable people with a full spectrum of goals to fulfil their version of success without being chained to their company headquarters at a 9-5 desk.

## Individual contributors

Big tech giants like Google pioneered the "IC" career path as a high-paying and senior alternative to becoming a manager. Technically-specialized workers no longer need to move to a management track in order to move forward in their careers.

Remote work lends well to this career path, since the tools used by individual contributors are largely asynchronous and natively built for remote work.

## Management path

There is now a career path for those who want to manage people _and_ work remotely. This career trajectory is going to be more widely accepted at a fully distributed company, but it’s possible on any team that embraces a remote-first culture.

To become a manager, it’s important to provide value outside of your trade skill that you were hired for. Start becoming a connector of people, a high-level problem solver, and help people when they ask. Doing things to help grow the company and keep people productive will get you noticed by leadership.

## Grow your skillset

Continuing to learn should always be part of your job. If you feel comfortable, it’s probably time to shake things up before your ideas become stale. Find ways to learn new technologies and teach other people based on your experience (both technical and non-technical).

If your company doesn’t have the resources to support your growth, find ways to do it independently.

Take online classes:

- Udemy

- Coursera

- edX

- General Assembly

- Lambda School

- Master Class

- Egghead

- Udacity

Speak at conferences and meetups:

## Build your network

Isolation and loneliness are common complaints of remote workers. Growing a professional network is certainly easier in a shared office, where you don’t have to try very hard to see people in your daily routine.

As a remote worker you need to put more effort in to meet people, but you also get to curate and have more control over who those people are, and how often you engage.

Your network will compound over time, and is one of the most valuable tools as you navigate through various stages of your career. Try setting a goal for yourself - like one meeting with a new person in your network per week.

**Online communities**: Join Slack or Forum communities based on technology skills or personal interests. Some of our favorites:

- Gopher Slack channel

- Vue.js Discord channel

- Ladies Get Paid

- Nomad’s List

- Stripe Atlas

- Tech Ladies

**In-person**: Tap into local events, meet people 1:1, or go to small group dinners. Some ideas for you:

- Find tech or hobby clubs through Meetup.com

- Lunch Club

- Creative Mornings

- Bumble Bizz or Bumble BFF

**Co-working**: One of the best ways to meet people in an organic way. Find an office locally where you can "go to work" and casually build a group of friends at the same location. Some resources to find a space near you:

- Croissant

- Kettle

- Spacious

- WeWork

- The Wing

- Soho Works
