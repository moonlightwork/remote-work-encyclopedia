# Career growth

In the old world of work, you had to choose between flexibility and success. It was rare to find a position where you could work outside the headquarters, set your own hours, _and_ maintain career growth.

The normalization of remote work has completely changed this. Modern tools enable people with a full spectrum of goals to fulfil their version of success without being chained to their company headquarters at a 9-5 desk.

## Individual contributors

Big tech giants like Google pioneered the "IC" (Individual Contributor) career path as a high-paying and senior alternative to becoming a manager. Remote work lends well to this career path, since the tools used by individual contributors are largely asynchronous and built for a deep work mindset.

## Management path

There is now a career path for those who want to manage people _and_ work remotely. This career trajectory is going to be more widely accepted at a fully distributed company, but it’s possible on any team that embraces a remote-first culture.

## Learn, grow, teach

Continuing to learn should always be part of your job. If you feel comfortable, it’s probably time to shake things up before your ideas become stale. Find ways to learn new technologies and teach other people based on your experience (both technical and non-technical).

If your company doesn’t have the resources to support your growth, find ways to do it independently.

Join a program with teachers and mentors, or just take a few video tutorials to stay relevant. You don't need to go into debt at a traditional University in order to continue your education.

#### Speak at conferences and meetups:
Research conferences that are relevant to your skillset, and start applying to speak. Conferences are usually looking for a diverse set of speakers - so even if you've never done it before, it's worth reaching out. 

Speaking at conferences is a great way to meet people outside your organization, form a stronger opinion on your work, and help others grow. You might even get a free trip out of it!

- [How and why to speak at tech conferences](https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0): Before you start speaking at conferences, you should figure out why you want to.

Find a way to teach other people your skills. Mentor people who are trying to break into the industry or learn a new coding language. The process of teaching someone else will increase your personal knowledge, give you experience as a leader, and help grow your influence and network.

## Build your network

As a remote worker you need to put more effort in to meet people, but you also get to curate and have more control over who those people are, and how often you engage.

Your network will compound over time, and is one of the most valuable tools as you navigate through various stages of your career. Try setting a goal for yourself - like one meeting with a new person in your network per week.
