# Work as a digital nomad

We’re picking back up on the introduction story! After four months in Mexico City, Emma and Philip (Moonlight founders) traded in their taco diet to try out some other cities around the world. They lived as digital nomads for over two years while building a platform where like-minded individuals could do the same.

They spent 2-4 months in each city while working remotely the whole time. It was an amazing adventure, but also took lots of planning, financial stress, and feelings of isolation. Not even #TacoTuesdays can remedy that.

The idea of doing what you love from anywhere in the world is freeing and exciting! 

But, there are many logistical and financial obstacles to overcome before you can launch your new flexible life. It’s surprising how many things are set up with the requirement that you have a physical home, and a permanent residence.

## Borders, laws, and visas

Border security and immigrant regulation is a very real challenge when you are traveling for extended periods of time. Make sure you understand how long you can stay in a country, what the local laws are, and what paperwork you may need to enter, work, and reside there.

## Taxes

If you are working full-time while traveling, the tax burden likely won't be much different from taxes while living somewhere permanently. You will still need to pay them somewhere. The upside of traveling to more affordable locations is that you won't need as much income to support a quality lifestyle. 

Before you get to tax season, make sure to find a professional accountant who understands your digital nomad lifestyle. Living and working without a permanent residence is a relatively new phenomenon, so you may need to do a lot of explaining.

## Meet people!

Traveling full-time while working is an extreme life experiment that can lead to isolation. You will need to find people - either locals or other travelers - to connect with. While you may find those connections organically, it's worth investing in a few travel or entrepreneur communities to meet more people.

## Get settled quickly for productivity

When moving around frequently, it’s hard to build a routine and feel grounded. The constant change can really affect your productivity, sense of self, and mental health day-to-day.

Get settled into a routine as quickly as possible in order to maximize your time. 

- **Find a place to work**: You can work from the place you are living, jump around to different public spaces with wifi, or find a co-working space. If you are staying in one place for more than a month, find a stable co-working space. Ask for a shorter rentals than normal and pay upfront in cash or at a slightly higher fee.

- **Set up an exercise plan**: Find a gym, a daily walking path, or a local yoga studio. Adding exercise to your daily routine will help you feel engaged in the community and add some structure to your otherwise fluid lifestyle. Like co-working, many businesses will negotiate a shorter-term plan if they know you are there temporarily.

- **Find the closest grocery store**: Make sure your temporary home is stocked with the essentials you need to feel at home. Find a local store near your accommodations and buy basics on the first day. You will feel like you live there, it’s more affordable, and you’ll learn more about how locals live. 

## Insurance

Stay protected in case the unexpected happens. You could lose your laptop, run out of a prescription, or get food poisoning. All of your things could get stolen, or you could get badly injured.

When Emma and Philip were living in Spain, they had everything stolen from an Airbnb (with no insurance!). They learned the hard lesson of why you need insurance - so you don’t have to.

#### Health Insurance

While outside your comfort zone or country of residence, you still need to be covered. Most national insurance plans will not cover you while traveling. You will need to get one blanket international plan, or added coverage.

- [GeoBlue](https://www.geo-blue.com/): Through our elite network of providers, innovative mobile and online tools, and high touch approach to customer service, GeoBlue provides peace of mind to members anywhere in the world.

#### Property insurance

Your computer is how you make money, connect with family, and schedule travel. Make sure you have all necessary supplies covered. Try to find property insurance that will cover each of your assets if they are damaged or stolen. 

From personal experience, it really sucks when you are on a budget and have to buy everything you own **_again_**.
