# Work as a digital nomad

We’re picking back up on the introduction story! Shortly after traveling to Mexico City, Emma and Phillip (Moonlight founders) traded in their taco diet to explore street cuisine in other cities. They lived as digital nomads for two years while building a platform where like-minded individuals could do the same.

They spent 2-4 months in each city while working remotely the whole time. It was an amazing adventure, but also took lots of planning, financial stress, and feelings of isolation. Not even #TacoTuesdays can remedy that.

The idea of doing what you love from anywhere in the world is freeing and exciting! But, there are many logistical and financial obstacles to overcome before you can really do it.

## The logistics

The world is not currently built for the modern globalized age. Logistics are the hardest thing about making the transition away from a single location. It’s surprising how many things are set up on the assumption (or requirement) that you have a physical home, and a permanent residence.

### Set up a digital mailbox

Yes, you still need an address for many things. Credit cards, voting, taxes, medical bills, insurance, prescriptions - all of these life obligations require that you have a "physical address". They will scan your mail, send you PDF copies, process checks, recycle what you don’t need, and forward your mail when needed. They are HIPPA compliant, and are trusted by many large organizations.

Recommended mailboxes:

- Earth Class Mail

- Virtual Post Mail

- Traveling Mailbox

### Get a travel credit card

Whether for work or personal, take advantage of cards with points on travel and other perks. Make sure to also prioritize cards that include travel insurance and lounge access at the airport (built in co-working!). You may have to pay annually for access to some of these cards, but it will more than pay itself back if you are moving around frequently.

Recommended travel cards:

- Amex Platinum

- Capital One Venture card

- Chase Reserve

### Borders, laws, and visas

Border security and immigrant regulation is a very real challenge when you are traveling for extended periods of time. Make sure you understand how long you can stay in a country, what the local laws are, and what paperwork you may need to enter, work, and reside there.

### Taxes

Note that we are not accountants, so you should hire a professional! Taxes while traveling are not much different from taxes while living somewhere permanently. You will still need to pay them somewhere!

### Meet people!

Traveling full-time while working is an extreme life experiment! You will need to find people - either locals or other travelers - to connect with. There are tons of resources out there to help you connect both personally and professionally in a new place.

Where to find friends and connections:

- Nomads list

- Bumble BFF

- Indie Hackers

- Remote Year

- Hacker Paradise

- Outsite

## Get settled quickly for productivity

When moving around frequently, it’s hard to build a routine and feel grounded. The constant change can really affect your productivity, sense of self, and mental health day-to-day.

Try to get settled into a routine as quickly as possible in order to maximize your time. Try to figure out your basic necessities on day one!

- **Find a place to work**: Choose what kind of work environment makes you most productive. You can work from the place you are living, jump around to different public spaces with wifi, or find a co-working space. If you are in a place for more than a month, you probably want to find a stable co-working space. Many spaces will do shorter rentals than normal if you agree to pay up front, in cash, or at a slightly higher fee.

- **Set up an exercise plan**: Even if you are not usually into exercise, it’s worth adding it into your routine while living like the remote rebel you are. Find a gym, a daily walking path, or a local yoga studio. Adding exercise to your daily routine will help you feel engaged in the community and add some structure to your otherwise flexible lifestyle. Like co-working, many businesses will negotiate a shorter-term plan if they know you are there temporarily.

- **Find the closest grocery store**: Make sure your temporary home is stocked with the essentials you need to feel at home. Find a local store near your accommodations and buy basics on the first day. You will feel like you live there, it’s more affordable, and you’ll learn more about how locals eat!

## Insurance while traveling

Stay protected in case the unexpected happens. You could lose your laptop, run out of a prescription, or get food poisoning. All of your things could get stolen, and you could get badly injured.

When Emma and Philip were living in Spain, they had everything stolen from an Airbnb (with no insurance!). Luckily, they learned that hard lesson of why you need insurance - so you don’t have to.

### Health Insurance

Traveling can be risky. While outside your comfort zone or country of residence, you still need to be covered. Most national insurance plans will not cover you while traveling, so you need an international plan.

### Property and travel insurance

Since your entire business is run from your computer, make sure you have all necessary supplies covered. Try to find property insurance that will cover each of your assets if they are damaged or stolen.
