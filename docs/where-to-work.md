# Where to work

Some remote workers love to work from home, and others need the separation of an office to feel sane. The great thing about a remote team is that you have options, and each person can create their own setup.

## Setting up shop

After years of working remotely, we believe that co-working or home office setup should be part of the compensation package for employees. This ensures that the office setup is a productivity _option_, not a monetary decision that falls on workers.

- **Home office**: Make sure that a home office is set up for productivity. This means having a quiet devoted space with a desk, an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Reducing distractions is key to a successful WFH setup.

- **Coworking**: Find the right co-working space for your preferences. There are a wide variety of options, each with their own vibe. You can do a trial day in most offices to make sure it matches your version of productivity. There are often a variety of plans ranging from pay-per-day to devoted offices.

- **Coffee shops or public spaces**: There are several services like Spacious and Kettle that provide a membership-based coworking service when shops are not in peak hours. If you are going to an establishment during normal hours, make sure you buy their products in exchange for the space and free wifi, and leave once youâ€™ve overstayed your welcome.
