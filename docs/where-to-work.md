# Your remote office

Some remote workers love to work from home, and others need the separation of an office to feel sane. The great thing about a remote team is that each person can create their own preferred office setup.

## Where to work

After years of working remotely, we believe that co-working or home office setup should be part of the compensation package for employees. This ensures that the office setup is a productivity _option_, not a monetary decision that falls on workers.

#### Make a home office 
Make sure that a home office is set up for productivity. This means having a quiet devoted space with a desk, an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Reducing distractions is key to a successful WFH setup.

#### Work from a local coworking space
Find the right co-working space for your preferences. There are a wide variety of options, each with their own vibe. You can do a trial day in most offices to make sure it matches your version of productivity. There are often a variety of plans ranging from pay-per-day to devoted offices.

#### Find remote-friendly spaces 
Working from coffee shops and public spaces can be refreshing every once in a while. In some cities, you can find platforms that provide a membership-based coworking service for access to shops that are not in peak hours. If you are going to an establishment during normal hours, make sure you buy their products in exchange for the space and free wifi, and leave once you’ve overstayed your welcome:)

## Build out your remote office
Find the things that help you be most productive. If you work at a remote company, most employees will get a monthly or yearly stipend to help build out the office. If you are a freelancer or just getting started, there are also cheaper ways to get the same general setup.

## Find a place to work near you

#### Co-working
Most major cities have a variety of co-working spaces to choose from.

You can often get access for just a few days a month, or unlimited access for full rent.
