## Technologies

This repo is built using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). If you want a general introduction, we recommend [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv1ItUzktc).

## Installation

[Install the Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to develop in it, then call the command `yarn` in this directory to install the required dependencies.

You can see if you have Yarn installed by running `yarn --version` in your terminal. If the command is not installed, then you can install Yarn on macOS and Unix by running this script in your terminal:

```sh
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

## Developing

After installing the require dependencies, run these commands from this directory:

1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
2. Boot the development environment: `yarn run dev`.

You will be able to access the code on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). As you change the text, it will update the website automatically.

When you are done, stop the development server by closing the shell session or running `Ctrl`+`c` on your keyboard.

The main content for the website is in the `docs/` folder, formatted as [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) (with some [extensions](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html))
